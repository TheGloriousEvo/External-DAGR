## 📖 Deep Setup Instructions

### Step 1 — Install Node.js

Download and install **Node.js LTS** from:
👉 https://nodejs.org

> Node.js is required to run the local bridge server and the companion app. Without it, nothing will start.

---

### Step 2 — Install a PBO Extractor

Download `ExtractPbo.exe` from:
👉 https://mikero.bytex.digital/Downloads

> If you've ever made Arma missions, you likely already have this.

---

### Step 3 — Subscribe to the Workshop Mod

Subscribe and enable **@microdagr_bridge** in the Arma 3 Launcher:
👉 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3700274411

---

### Step 4 — Download This Repo (Bridge + App)

Clone or download this repository, then open the root folder and continue below.

---

### Step 5 — Run the Automatic Setup

**5.1** Run `Install_All.bat`

**5.2** Run `Start_Launcher.bat` — a launcher window should appear.

In the launcher window, click **Start All**.

- Launch Arma 3 with the **@microdagr_bridge** mod enabled.
- Open the local or network app link shown in the launcher.

## Alternative Methods *(if the above fails)*

### Manual Dependency Installation
> Only if `Install_All.bat` fails:
```bash
# In arma-bridge/
npm install

# In microdagr-app/
npm install
```

### Manual Startup
> Only if `Start_Launcher.bat` fails:

- Run `Start_Bridge.bat`
- Run `Start_App.bat`

---

## Notes

- All data is processed **locally on your PC** (LAN/local usage only).
- Some advanced telemetry integrations are improved when **ACE/CBA** features are available.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

| Component | Folder / File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Arma addon | `@microdagr_bridge/` | SQF addon that writes telemetry to Arma `.rpt` logs |
| Telemetry bridge | `arma-bridge/` | Node.js HTTP/WebSocket server — reads `.rpt`, serves telemetry, builds map assets |
| Frontend app | `microdagr-app/` | React + Vite UI — connects to bridge WebSocket, renders map and markers |
| One-click launchers | `Start_All.bat`, `Start_Bridge.bat`, `Start_App.bat` | Start scripts for bridge and app |
| One-click setup | `Install_All.bat`, `Install_All.ps1` | Installs dependencies and checks tool prerequisites |
| GUI launcher | `MicroDAGR_Launcher.ps1`, `Start_Launcher.bat` | Desktop launcher UI with status indicators and links |
| EXE builder (optional) | `Build_Launcher_EXE.bat` | Builds `MicroDAGR_Launcher.exe` from PowerShell launcher |
| Setup EXE builder (optional) | `Build_Install_All_EXE.bat` | Builds `Install_All.exe` for single-click dependency setup |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Bridge does not start
- Ensure **Node.js** is installed and available on PATH.
- Ensure port `8080` is free.
- Run manually in `arma-bridge/`: `npm start`

### App does not start
- Ensure port `5173` is free.
- Run manually in `microdagr-app/`: `npm run dev -- --host --port 5173 --strictPort`

### No telemetry in app
- Confirm Arma 3 launched with `@microdagr_bridge` enabled.
- Check latest `.rpt` file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arma 3`.
- Verify bridge health at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/health` — look for `hasTelemetry: true`.

### Map quality issues
- Verify `ExtractPbo.exe` is installed and detected.
- Review the tool diagnostics printed by `Start_Bridge.bat` on startup.
- If using a non-standard extractor binary, set `MICRODAGR_PBO_EXTRACT_CMD` with `{input}` and `{output}` placeholders.

## 🛠️ For Developers: Addon Packaging

If you modify any source files under `@microdagr_bridge/addons/microdagr_bridge/`, you must rebuild the PBO before testing in-game.

| | Path |
|---|---|
| **Source folder** | `@microdagr_bridge/addons/microdagr_bridge/` |
| **Output folder** | `@microdagr_bridge/addons/` |
| **Expected PBO** | `@microdagr_bridge/addons/microdagr_bridge.pbo` |

> `Start_Bridge.bat` will warn you if source files are newer than the compiled PBO.

## Notes

- All data is processed **locally on your PC** (LAN/local usage only, no cloud).
- ACE/CBA are not hard-required, but some telemetry features (Vector 21 rangefinder data, etc.) are only available when ACE is loaded.
